## Security

Microsoft places a high priority on the security of its software products and services. This commitment extends to all source code repositories managed under our GitHub organizations, including [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that aligns with [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/security.md/definition), please report it to us using the guidelines below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report).

If you'd prefer not to log in, you can send an email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key, which can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If you donâ€™t, please follow up via email to ensure your original message was received. Additional details are available at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

To help us better understand and address the potential issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

  * Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of the source file(s) where the issue occurs
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration needed to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

Providing this information will help us address your report more efficiently.

If you are submitting a report for a bug bounty, providing a more comprehensive report can result in a higher reward. For details about our active programs, please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page.
