# Fine-tune Phi3 using Olive

In this example, you will use Olive to:

1. Fine-tune a LoRA adapter to classify phrases into Sad, Joy, Fear, Surprise.
2. Merge the adapter weights into the base model.
3. Optimize and quantize the model into `int4`.

We'll also demonstrate how to perform inference with the fine-tuned model using the ONNX Runtime (ORT) Generate API.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è For fine-tuning, you'll need access to a suitable GPU, such as an A10, V100, or A100.**

## üíæ Install

Start by creating a new Python virtual environment (e.g., using `conda`):

```bash
conda create -n olive-ai python=3.11
conda activate olive-ai
```

Next, install Olive along with the dependencies needed for the fine-tuning workflow:

```bash
cd Phi-3CookBook/code/04.Finetuning/olive-ort-example
pip install olive-ai[gpu]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üß™ Fine-tune Phi3 using Olive
The [Olive configuration file](../../../../../code/03.Finetuning/olive-ort-example/phrase-classification.json) defines a *workflow* that includes the following *passes*:

Phi3 -> LoRA -> MergeAdapterWeights -> ModelBuilder

At a high level, this workflow will:

1. Fine-tune Phi3 (for 150 steps by default, which you can adjust) using the data from [dataset/data-classification.json](../../../../../code/03.Finetuning/olive-ort-example/dataset/dataset-classification.json).
2. Merge the LoRA adapter weights into the base model, resulting in a single ONNX-format model artifact.
3. Use Model Builder to optimize the model for ONNX Runtime and quantize it into `int4`.

To execute the workflow, run:

```bash
olive run --config phrase-classification.json
```

Once Olive completes the process, your optimized `int4` fine-tuned Phi3 model will be available at: `code/04.Finetuning/olive-ort-example/models/lora-merge-mb/gpu-cuda_model`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Integrate fine-tuned Phi3 into your application 

To run the application:

```bash
python app/app.py --phrase "cricket is a wonderful sport!" --model-path models/lora-merge-mb/gpu-cuda_model
```

The response will be a single-word classification of the phrase (Sad/Joy/Fear/Surprise).
