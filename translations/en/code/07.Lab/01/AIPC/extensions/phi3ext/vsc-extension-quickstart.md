# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all the files you need for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file where you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and specifies its title and command name. With this information, VS Code can display the command in the command palette. At this stage, the plugin doesnâ€™t need to be loaded yet.
* `src/extension.ts` - this is the main file where the implementation of your command is defined.
  * The file exports a function, `activate`, which gets called the first time your extension is activated (in this case, when the command is executed). Inside the `activate` function, we call `registerCommand`.
  * The function containing the command's implementation is passed as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Setup

* Install the recommended extensions (amodio.tsl-problem-matcher, ms-vscode.extension-test-runner, and dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside `src/extension.ts` to debug your extension.
* View the output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* After making changes to the code in `src/extension.ts`, you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar.
* Alternatively, you can reload the VS Code window (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) to apply your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can access the complete API documentation by opening the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.

## Run tests

* Install the [Extension Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.extension-test-runner).
* Use the **Tasks: Run Task** command to start the "watch" task. Ensure this is running; otherwise, tests may not be detected.
* Open the Testing view from the activity bar and click the "Run Test" button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + ; A`.
* Check the test results in the Test Results view.
* Modify `src/test/extension.test.ts` or add new test files in the `test` folder.
  * The test runner only recognizes files matching the pattern `**.test.ts`.
  * You can organize your tests by creating subfolders within the `test` folder.

## Go further

* Optimize your extension's size and startup time by [bundling your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension?WT.mc_id=aiml-137032-kinfeylo).
* [Publish your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension?WT.mc_id=aiml-137032-kinfeylo) to the VS Code extension marketplace.
* Set up [Continuous Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/continuous-integration?WT.mc_id=aiml-137032-kinfeylo) to automate builds.
