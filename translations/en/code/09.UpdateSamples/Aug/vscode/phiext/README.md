# phiext README

This is the README for your "phiext" extension. After writing a brief description, we suggest including the following sections.

## Features

Describe the specific features of your extension, including screenshots of it in action. Image paths should be relative to this README file.

For example, if there's an image folder in your extension project workspace:
