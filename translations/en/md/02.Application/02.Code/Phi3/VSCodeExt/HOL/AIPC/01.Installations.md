# **Lab 0 - Installation**

When we begin the Lab, we need to set up the appropriate environment:

### **1. Python 3.11+**

It is recommended to use Miniforge to configure your Python environment.

To set up Miniforge, refer to [https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

Once Miniforge is set up, run the following command in PowerShell:

```bash

conda create -n pyenv python==3.11.8 -y

conda activate pyenv

```

### **2. Install Prompt flow SDK**

In Lab 1, we will use Prompt flow, so you need to install the Prompt flow SDK.

```bash

pip install promptflow --upgrade

```

You can verify the installation of the Prompt flow SDK using this command:

```bash

pf --version

```

### **3. Install Visual Studio Code Prompt flow Extension**

### **4. Intel NPU Acceleration Library**

Intel's latest processors support NPU. If you want to run LLMs/SLMs locally using NPU, you can use the ***Intel NPU Acceleration Library***. For more details, visit [https://github.com/microsoft/PhiCookBook/blob/main/md/01.Introduction/03/AIPC_Inference.md](https://github.com/microsoft/PhiCookBook/blob/main/md/01.Introduction/03/AIPC_Inference.md).

Install the Intel NPU Acceleration Library in bash:

```bash

pip install intel-npu-acceleration-library

```

***Note***: Please ensure that this library supports transformers version ***4.40.2***. Confirm the version before proceeding.

### **5. Other Python Libraries**

Create a `requirements.txt` file and add the following content:

```txt

notebook
numpy 
scipy 
scikit-learn 
matplotlib 
pandas 
pillow 
graphviz

```

### **6. Install NVM**

Install NVM in PowerShell:

```bash

winget install -e --id CoreyButler.NVMforWindows

```

Install Node.js version 18.20:

```bash

nvm install 18.20.0

nvm use 18.20.0

```

### **7. Install Visual Studio Code Development Support**

```bash

npm install --global yo generator-code

```

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the SDK. Now, proceed to the hands-on exercises.
