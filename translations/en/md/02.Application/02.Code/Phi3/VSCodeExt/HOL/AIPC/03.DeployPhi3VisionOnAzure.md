# **Lab 3 - Deploy Phi-3-Vision on Azure Machine Learning Service**

We use NPU to complete the production deployment of local code, and then we aim to integrate PHI-3-VISION capabilities to convert images into code.

In this guide, we will quickly set up a Model-As-Service Phi-3-Vision service using Azure Machine Learning Service.

***Note***: Phi-3-Vision requires significant computing power to generate content efficiently. Cloud computing resources are essential to accomplish this.

### **1. Create Azure Machine Learning Service**

We need to create an Azure Machine Learning Service in the Azure Portal. If you're unsure how to do this, please refer to the following link: [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources?view=azureml-api-2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources?view=azureml-api-2)

### **2. Choose Phi-3 Vision in Azure Machine Learning Service**

### **3. Deploy Phi-3-Vision in Azure**

### **4. Test Endpoint in Postman**

***Note***

1. The parameters to be sent must include Authorization, azureml-model-deployment, and Content-Type. You need to check the deployment details to retrieve these values.

2. When sending parameters, Phi-3-Vision requires an image link. Refer to the GPT-4-Vision method for parameter transmission, such as:

```json

{
  "input_data":{
    "input_string":[
      {
        "role":"user",
        "content":[ 
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "You are a Python coding assistant.Please create Python code for image "
          },
          {
              "type": "image_url",
              "image_url": {
                "url": "https://ajaytech.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/index.png"
              }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "parameters":{
          "temperature": 0.6,
          "top_p": 0.9,
          "do_sample": false,
          "max_new_tokens": 2048
    }
  }
}

```

3. Use the **Post** method to call **/score**.

**Congratulations**! You have successfully completed the quick deployment of PHI-3-VISION and experimented with generating code from images. Next, you can start building applications by combining NPUs with cloud resources.
