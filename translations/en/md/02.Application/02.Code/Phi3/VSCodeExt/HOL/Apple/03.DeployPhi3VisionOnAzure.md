# **Lab 3 - Deploy Phi-3-Vision on Azure Machine Learning Service**

We use an NPU to complete the production deployment of local code, and then leverage it to introduce PHI-3-VISION for generating code from images.

In this guide, we will quickly build a Model-as-a-Service Phi-3 Vision solution using Azure Machine Learning Service.

***Note***: Phi-3 Vision requires significant computational resources to generate content efficiently. Cloud computing power is essential to achieve this.

### **1. Create Azure Machine Learning Service**

First, create an Azure Machine Learning Service in the Azure Portal. For detailed instructions, visit this link: [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources?view=azureml-api-2](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/quickstart-create-resources?view=azureml-api-2)

### **2. Select Phi-3 Vision in Azure Machine Learning Service**

### **3. Deploy Phi-3-Vision on Azure**

### **4. Test the Endpoint in Postman**

***Note***

1. The transmitted parameters must include Authorization, azureml-model-deployment, and Content-Type. You will need to review the deployment details to retrieve this information.

2. When transmitting parameters, Phi-3-Vision requires an image link. Refer to the GPT-4-Vision method for parameter transmission, such as:

```json

{
  "input_data":{
    "input_string":[
      {
        "role":"user",
        "content":[ 
          {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "You are a Python coding assistant.Please create Python code for image "
          },
          {
              "type": "image_url",
              "image_url": {
                "url": "https://ajaytech.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/index.png"
              }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "parameters":{
          "temperature": 0.6,
          "top_p": 0.9,
          "do_sample": false,
          "max_new_tokens": 2048
    }
  }
}

```

3. Use the **/score** endpoint with the POST method.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully deployed PHI-3-VISION and experimented with generating code from images. Moving forward, you can explore building applications by combining NPUs with cloud capabilities.
