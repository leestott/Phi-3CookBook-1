## How to Use Chat-Completion Components from the Azure ML System Registry to Fine-Tune a Model

In this example, we will fine-tune the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model to complete a conversation between two individuals using the ultrachat_200k dataset.

![MLFineTune](../../../../translated_images/MLFineTune.d8292fe1f146b4ff1153c2e5bdbbe5b0e7f96858d5054b525bd55f2641505138.en.png)

This example will demonstrate how to fine-tune a model using the Azure ML SDK and Python, and then deploy the fine-tuned model to an online endpoint for real-time inference.

### Training Data

We will use the ultrachat_200k dataset, which is a heavily filtered version of the UltraChat dataset. This dataset was used to train Zephyr-7B-Î², a cutting-edge 7B chat model.

### Model

The Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model will be used to show how a user can fine-tune a model for chat-completion tasks. If you opened this notebook from a specific model card, remember to replace the model name accordingly.

### Tasks

- Select a model to fine-tune.
- Select and explore the training data.
- Configure the fine-tuning job.
- Run the fine-tuning job.
- Review training and evaluation metrics.
- Register the fine-tuned model.
- Deploy the fine-tuned model for real-time inference.
- Clean up resources.

## 1. Set Up Pre-Requisites

- Install dependencies.
- Connect to the AzureML Workspace. Learn more about setting up SDK authentication. Replace `<WORKSPACE_NAME>`, `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`, and `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>` below.
- Connect to the AzureML system registry.
- Optionally set an experiment name.
- Check or create the compute resources.

> [!NOTE]
> A single GPU node can have multiple GPU cards. For instance, a Standard_NC24rs_v3 node has 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, while a Standard_NC12s_v3 node has 2 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Refer to the documentation for details. The `gpus_per_node` parameter below sets the number of GPU cards per node. Setting this value correctly ensures full utilization of all GPUs in the node. Recommended GPU compute SKUs can be found [here](../../../../md/03.FineTuning) and [here](../../../../md/03.FineTuning).

### Python Libraries

Install the necessary dependencies by running the cell below. This step is mandatory if you are running in a new environment.

```bash
pip install azure-ai-ml
pip install azure-identity
pip install datasets==2.9.0
pip install mlflow
pip install azureml-mlflow
```

### Interacting with Azure ML

1. This Python script is used to interact with the Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. Here's a summary of its functionality:

    - It imports necessary modules from `azure.ai.ml`, `azure.identity`, and `azure.ai.ml.entities`. It also imports the `time` module.
    - It attempts to authenticate using `DefaultAzureCredential()` for a simplified authentication process. If this fails, it falls back to `InteractiveBrowserCredential()` for an interactive login prompt.
    - It tries to create an `MLClient` instance using the `from_config` method, which reads configuration from the default config file (`config.json`). If this fails, it manually creates an `MLClient` instance by providing `subscription_id`, `resource_group_name`, and `workspace_name`.
    - It creates another `MLClient` instance for the Azure ML registry named "azureml," where models, fine-tuning pipelines, and environments are stored.
    - It sets the experiment name to "chat_completion_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct."
    - It generates a unique timestamp using the current time. This can be used to create unique names and versions.

    ```python
    # Import necessary modules from Azure ML and Azure Identity
    from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
    from azure.identity import (
        DefaultAzureCredential,
        InteractiveBrowserCredential,
    )
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import AmlCompute
    import time  # Import time module
    
    # Try to authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential
    try:
        credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
        credential.get_token("https://management.azure.com/.default")
    except Exception as ex:  # If DefaultAzureCredential fails, use InteractiveBrowserCredential
        credential = InteractiveBrowserCredential()
    
    # Try to create an MLClient instance using the default config file
    try:
        workspace_ml_client = MLClient.from_config(credential=credential)
    except:  # If that fails, create an MLClient instance by manually providing the details
        workspace_ml_client = MLClient(
            credential,
            subscription_id="<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>",
            resource_group_name="<RESOURCE_GROUP>",
            workspace_name="<WORKSPACE_NAME>",
        )
    
    # Create another MLClient instance for the Azure ML registry named "azureml"
    # This registry is where models, fine-tuning pipelines, and environments are stored
    registry_ml_client = MLClient(credential, registry_name="azureml")
    
    # Set the experiment name
    experiment_name = "chat_completion_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
    
    # Generate a unique timestamp that can be used for names and versions that need to be unique
    timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
    ```

## 2. Select a Foundation Model to Fine-Tune

1. The Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open model with 3.8B parameters. Built upon datasets used for Phi-2, this model belongs to the Phi-3 family. The "Mini" version supports two context lengths: 4K and 128K tokens. Fine-tuning is required to tailor the model for specific tasks. You can browse these models in the Model Catalog in AzureML Studio by filtering for the chat-completion task. In this example, we use the Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct model. If you are using a different model, replace the model name and version accordingly.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The model's `id` property will be passed as input to the fine-tuning job. This can also be found as the "Asset ID" field on the model's details page in AzureML Studio's Model Catalog.

2. This Python script interacts with the Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. Here's a summary:

    - The model name is set to "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct."
    - It retrieves the latest version of the model from the Azure ML registry using the `get` method of the `models` property on the `registry_ml_client` object.
    - It prints the model's name, version, and ID, which will be used for fine-tuning.

    ```python
    # Set the model name
    model_name = "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
    
    # Get the latest version of the model from the Azure ML registry
    foundation_model = registry_ml_client.models.get(model_name, label="latest")
    
    # Print the model name, version, and id
    # This information is useful for tracking and debugging
    print(
        "\n\nUsing model name: {0}, version: {1}, id: {2} for fine tuning".format(
            foundation_model.name, foundation_model.version, foundation_model.id
        )
    )
    ```

## 3. Create Compute Resources for the Job

The fine-tuning job works ONLY with GPU compute. The size of the compute depends on the model's size, which can make selecting the right compute tricky. This section guides you in choosing the appropriate compute.

> [!NOTE]
> The computes listed below are optimized for the given configurations. Any configuration changes may lead to CUDA Out of Memory errors. In such cases, upgrade to a larger compute size.

> [!NOTE]
> When selecting the `compute_cluster_size` below, ensure the compute is available in your resource group. If a specific compute is unavailable, you may need to request access.

### Checking Model for Fine-Tuning Support

1. This Python script checks if the model supports fine-tuning on specific compute sizes:

    - It uses the `ast` module to process the Python abstract syntax tree.
    - It checks for the presence of a `finetune_compute_allow_list` tag in the model's metadata.
    - If the tag exists, it parses its value into a Python list and prints a message suggesting creating a compute from the list.
    - If the tag is absent, it sets `computes_allow_list` to `None` and prints a message.

    ```python
    # Import the ast module, which provides functions to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar
    import ast
    
    # Check if the 'finetune_compute_allow_list' tag is present in the model's tags
    if "finetune_compute_allow_list" in foundation_model.tags:
        # If the tag is present, use ast.literal_eval to safely parse the tag's value (a string) into a Python list
        computes_allow_list = ast.literal_eval(
            foundation_model.tags["finetune_compute_allow_list"]
        )  # convert string to python list
        # Print a message indicating that a compute should be created from the list
        print(f"Please create a compute from the above list - {computes_allow_list}")
    else:
        # If the tag is not present, set computes_allow_list to None
        computes_allow_list = None
        # Print a message indicating that the 'finetune_compute_allow_list' tag is not part of the model's tags
        print("`finetune_compute_allow_list` is not part of model tags")
    ```

### Checking Compute Instance

1. This Python script performs several checks on a compute instance in the Azure ML workspace:

    - It verifies the provisioning state of the compute instance.
    - It checks the compute size against an allow list or deny list.
    - It retrieves the number of GPUs in the compute instance.
    - If any of these checks fail, it raises an error.

    ```python
    # Print the exception message
    print(e)
    # Raise a ValueError if the compute size is not available in the workspace
    raise ValueError(
        f"WARNING! Compute size {compute_cluster_size} not available in workspace"
    )
    
    # Retrieve the compute instance from the Azure ML workspace
    compute = workspace_ml_client.compute.get(compute_cluster)
    # Check if the provisioning state of the compute instance is "failed"
    if compute.provisioning_state.lower() == "failed":
        # Raise a ValueError if the provisioning state is "failed"
        raise ValueError(
            f"Provisioning failed, Compute '{compute_cluster}' is in failed state. "
            f"please try creating a different compute"
        )
    
    # Check if computes_allow_list is not None
    if computes_allow_list is not None:
        # Convert all compute sizes in computes_allow_list to lowercase
        computes_allow_list_lower_case = [x.lower() for x in computes_allow_list]
        # Check if the size of the compute instance is in computes_allow_list_lower_case
        if compute.size.lower() not in computes_allow_list_lower_case:
            # Raise a ValueError if the size of the compute instance is not in computes_allow_list_lower_case
            raise ValueError(
                f"VM size {compute.size} is not in the allow-listed computes for finetuning"
            )
    else:
        # Define a list of unsupported GPU VM sizes
        unsupported_gpu_vm_list = [
            "standard_nc6",
            "standard_nc12",
            "standard_nc24",
            "standard_nc24r",
        ]
        # Check if the size of the compute instance is in unsupported_gpu_vm_list
        if compute.size.lower() in unsupported_gpu_vm_list:
            # Raise a ValueError if the size of the compute instance is in unsupported_gpu_vm_list
            raise ValueError(
                f"VM size {compute.size} is currently not supported for finetuning"
            )
    
    # Initialize a flag to check if the number of GPUs in the compute instance has been found
    gpu_count_found = False
    # Retrieve a list of all available compute sizes in the workspace
    workspace_compute_sku_list = workspace_ml_client.compute.list_sizes()
    available_sku_sizes = []
    # Iterate over the list of available compute sizes
    for compute_sku in workspace_compute_sku_list:
        available_sku_sizes.append(compute_sku.name)
        # Check if the name of the compute size matches the size of the compute instance
        if compute_sku.name.lower() == compute.size.lower():
            # If it does, retrieve the number of GPUs for that compute size and set gpu_count_found to True
            gpus_per_node = compute_sku.gpus
            gpu_count_found = True
    # If gpu_count_found is True, print the number of GPUs in the compute instance
    if gpu_count_found:
        print(f"Number of GPU's in compute {compute.size}: {gpus_per_node}")
    else:
        # If gpu_count_found is False, raise a ValueError
        raise ValueError(
            f"Number of GPU's in compute {compute.size} not found. Available skus are: {available_sku_sizes}."
            f"This should not happen. Please check the selected compute cluster: {compute_cluster} and try again."
        )
    ```

## 4. Select the Dataset for Fine-Tuning

1. The ultrachat_200k dataset will be used. It has four splits suitable for supervised fine-tuning (sft) and generation ranking (gen). The number of examples per split is shown below:

    ```bash
    train_sft test_sft  train_gen  test_gen
    207865  23110  256032  28304
    ```

### Visualize Sample Data Rows

To speed up this sample, we will save `train_sft` and `test_sft` files containing 5% of the trimmed rows. This will reduce accuracy, so the fine-tuned model should not be used in production.

1. The script `download-dataset.py` downloads the ultrachat_200k dataset and transforms it into a format consumable by the fine-tune pipeline component. Since the dataset is large, only part of it is used here.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some language models use different language codes, so dataset column names should reflect this.

1. Here's an example of how the data should look:
The chat-completion dataset is stored in Parquet format, with each entry following this schema:

    - `prompt`: A string representing a task or question posed to an AI assistant.
    - `messages`: An array of objects, each representing a conversation message. Each object includes:
        - `content`: The message text.
        - `role`: The sender's role ("user" or "assistant").
    - `prompt_id`: A unique identifier for the prompt.

1. A sample conversation might involve a user asking the assistant to create a dystopian story protagonist, followed by further interactions. The entire conversation is tied to a specific `prompt_id`.

    ```python
    {
        // The task or question posed to an AI assistant
        "prompt": "Create a fully-developed protagonist who is challenged to survive within a dystopian society under the rule of a tyrant. ...",
        
        // An array of objects, each representing a message in a conversation between a user and an AI assistant
        "messages":[
            {
                // The content of the user's message
                "content": "Create a fully-developed protagonist who is challenged to survive within a dystopian society under the rule of a tyrant. ...",
                // The role of the entity that sent the message
                "role": "user"
            },
            {
                // The content of the assistant's message
                "content": "Name: Ava\n\n Ava was just 16 years old when the world as she knew it came crashing down. The government had collapsed, leaving behind a chaotic and lawless society. ...",
                // The role of the entity that sent the message
                "role": "assistant"
            },
            {
                // The content of the user's message
                "content": "Wow, Ava's story is so intense and inspiring! Can you provide me with more details.  ...",
                // The role of the entity that sent the message
                "role": "user"
            }, 
            {
                // The content of the assistant's message
                "content": "Certainly! ....",
                // The role of the entity that sent the message
                "role": "assistant"
            }
        ],
        
        // A unique identifier for the prompt
        "prompt_id": "d938b65dfe31f05f80eb8572964c6673eddbd68eff3db6bd234d7f1e3b86c2af"
    }
    ```

### Download Data

1. This Python script downloads the dataset using the `download-dataset.py` helper script:

    - It specifies the dataset to download, the target directory, and the percentage of the dataset to split (5%).
    - If the download fails, it raises an exception.

    ```python
    # Import the os module, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality
    import os
    
    # Use the os.system function to run the download-dataset.py script in the shell with specific command-line arguments
    # The arguments specify the dataset to download (HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k), the directory to download it to (ultrachat_200k_dataset), and the percentage of the dataset to split (5)
    # The os.system function returns the exit status of the command it executed; this status is stored in the exit_status variable
    exit_status = os.system(
        "python ./download-dataset.py --dataset HuggingFaceH4/ultrachat_200k --download_dir ultrachat_200k_dataset --dataset_split_pc 5"
    )
    
    # Check if exit_status is not 0
    # In Unix-like operating systems, an exit status of 0 usually indicates that a command has succeeded, while any other number indicates an error
    # If exit_status is not 0, raise an Exception with a message indicating that there was an error downloading the dataset
    if exit_status != 0:
        raise Exception("Error downloading dataset")
    ```

### Load Data into a DataFrame

1. This Python script loads a JSON Lines file into a pandas DataFrame and displays the first 5 rows:

    - It sets pandas display options to show full column text.
    - It reads the `train_sft.jsonl` file into a DataFrame.
    - It displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.

    ```python
    # Import the pandas library, which is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Set the maximum column width for pandas' display options to 0
    # This means that the full text of each column will be displayed without truncation when the DataFrame is printed
    pd.set_option("display.max_colwidth", 0)
    
    # Use the pd.read_json function to load the train_sft.jsonl file from the ultrachat_200k_dataset directory into a DataFrame
    # The lines=True argument indicates that the file is in JSON Lines format, where each line is a separate JSON object
    df = pd.read_json("./ultrachat_200k_dataset/train_sft.jsonl", lines=True)
    
    # Use the head method to display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
    # If the DataFrame has less than 5 rows, it will display all of them
    df.head()
    ```

## 5. Submit the Fine-Tuning Job

Create a job using the chat-completion pipeline component. Learn more about the supported parameters for fine-tuning.

### Define Fine-Tuning Parameters

1. Fine-tuning parameters fall into two categories: training parameters and optimization parameters.

1. Training parameters include:
    - Optimizer and scheduler settings.
    - The metric to optimize.
    - Number of training steps, batch size, etc.

1. Optimization parameters improve GPU memory utilization and compute efficiency. These vary by model and are packaged with the model to handle differences.

    - Enable DeepSpeed and LoRA.
    - Enable mixed-precision training.
    - Enable multi-node training.

> [!NOTE]
> Supervised fine-tuning may result in alignment loss or catastrophic forgetting. We recommend checking for these issues and running an alignment stage after fine-tuning.

### Fine-Tuning Parameters

1. This Python script sets up fine-tuning parameters:

    - Defines default training parameters such as epochs, batch sizes, and learning rate.
    - Defines optimization parameters like DeepSpeed and LoRA settings.
    - Updates parameters with model-specific defaults if available.

    ```python
    # Set up default training parameters such as the number of training epochs, batch sizes for training and evaluation, learning rate, and learning rate scheduler type
    training_parameters = dict(
        num_train_epochs=3,
        per_device_train_batch_size=1,
        per_device_eval_batch_size=1,
        learning_rate=5e-6,
        lr_scheduler_type="cosine",
    )
    
    # Set up default optimization parameters such as whether to apply Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LoRa) and DeepSpeed, and the DeepSpeed stage
    optimization_parameters = dict(
        apply_lora="true",
        apply_deepspeed="true",
        deepspeed_stage=2,
    )
    
    # Combine the training and optimization parameters into a single dictionary called finetune_parameters
    finetune_parameters = {**training_parameters, **optimization_parameters}
    
    # Check if the foundation_model has any model-specific default parameters
    # If it does, print a warning message and update the finetune_parameters dictionary with these model-specific defaults
    # The ast.literal_eval function is used to convert the model-specific defaults from a string to a Python dictionary
    if "model_specific_defaults" in foundation_model.tags:
        print("Warning! Model specific defaults exist. The defaults could be overridden.")
        finetune_parameters.update(
            ast.literal_eval(  # convert string to python dict
                foundation_model.tags["model_specific_defaults"]
            )
        )
    
    # Print the final set of fine-tuning parameters that will be used for the run
    print(
        f"The following finetune parameters are going to be set for the run: {finetune_parameters}"
    )
    ```

### Training Pipeline

1. This Python script generates a display name for the training pipeline:

    - Calculates the total batch size based on various parameters.
    - Constructs a string including details like learning rate scheduler, DeepSpeed settings, LoRA, and more.
    - Prints the display name for the pipeline.

    ```python
    # Define a function to generate a display name for the training pipeline
    def get_pipeline_display_name():
        # Calculate the total batch size by multiplying the per-device batch size, the number of gradient accumulation steps, the number of GPUs per node, and the number of nodes used for fine-tuning
        batch_size = (
            int(finetune_parameters.get("per_device_train_batch_size", 1))
            * int(finetune_parameters.get("gradient_accumulation_steps", 1))
            * int(gpus_per_node)
            * int(finetune_parameters.get("num_nodes_finetune", 1))
        )
        # Retrieve the learning rate scheduler type
        scheduler = finetune_parameters.get("lr_scheduler_type", "linear")
        # Retrieve whether DeepSpeed is applied
        deepspeed = finetune_parameters.get("apply_deepspeed", "false")
        # Retrieve the DeepSpeed stage
        ds_stage = finetune_parameters.get("deepspeed_stage", "2")
        # If DeepSpeed is applied, include "ds" followed by the DeepSpeed stage in the display name; if not, include "nods"
        if deepspeed == "true":
            ds_string = f"ds{ds_stage}"
        else:
            ds_string = "nods"
        # Retrieve whether Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LoRa) is applied
        lora = finetune_parameters.get("apply_lora", "false")
        # If LoRa is applied, include "lora" in the display name; if not, include "nolora"
        if lora == "true":
            lora_string = "lora"
        else:
            lora_string = "nolora"
        # Retrieve the limit on the number of model checkpoints to keep
        save_limit = finetune_parameters.get("save_total_limit", -1)
        # Retrieve the maximum sequence length
        seq_len = finetune_parameters.get("max_seq_length", -1)
        # Construct the display name by concatenating all these parameters, separated by hyphens
        return (
            model_name
            + "-"
            + "ultrachat"
            + "-"
            + f"bs{batch_size}"
            + "-"
            + f"{scheduler}"
            + "-"
            + ds_string

    # Call the function to generate the display name
    pipeline_display_name = get_pipeline_display_name()
    # Print the display name
    print(f"Display name used for the run: {pipeline_display_name}")
    ```
### Training Pipeline
This script configures a training pipeline based on various parameters and prints its display name.  
```python
    # Define a function to generate a display name for the training pipeline
    def get_pipeline_display_name():
        # Calculate the total batch size by multiplying the per-device batch size, the number of gradient accumulation steps, the number of GPUs per node, and the number of nodes used for fine-tuning
        batch_size = (
            int(finetune_parameters.get("per_device_train_batch_size", 1))
            * int(finetune_parameters.get("gradient_accumulation_steps", 1))
            * int(gpus_per_node)
            * int(finetune_parameters.get("num_nodes_finetune", 1))
        )
        # Retrieve the learning rate scheduler type
        scheduler = finetune_parameters.get("lr_scheduler_type", "linear")
        # Retrieve whether DeepSpeed is applied
        deepspeed = finetune_parameters.get("apply_deepspeed", "false")
        # Retrieve the DeepSpeed stage
        ds_stage = finetune_parameters.get("deepspeed_stage", "2")
        # If DeepSpeed is applied, include "ds" followed by the DeepSpeed stage in the display name; if not, include "nods"
        if deepspeed == "true":
            ds_string = f"ds{ds_stage}"
        else:
            ds_string = "nods"
        # Retrieve whether Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LoRa) is applied
        lora = finetune_parameters.get("apply_lora", "false")
        # If LoRa is applied, include "lora" in the display name; if not, include "nolora"
        if lora == "true":
            lora_string = "lora"
        else:
            lora_string = "nolora"
        # Retrieve the limit on the number of model checkpoints to keep
        save_limit = finetune_parameters.get("save_total_limit", -1)
        # Retrieve the maximum sequence length
        seq_len = finetune_parameters.get("max_seq_length", -1)
        # Construct the display name by concatenating all these parameters, separated by hyphens
        return (
            model_name
            + "-"
            + "ultrachat"
            + "-"
            + f"bs{batch_size}"

        )

    ```  

### Configuring Pipeline
This Python script defines and configures a machine learning pipeline using the Azure Machine Learning SDK. Here's a breakdown of what it does:  
1. It imports the necessary modules from the Azure AI ML SDK.  
2. It retrieves a pipeline component named "chat_completion_pipeline" from the registry.  
3. It defines a pipeline job using the `@pipeline` decorator and the function `create_pipeline`. The name of the pipeline is set to `pipeline_display_name`.

1. Inside the `create_pipeline` function, it initializes the fetched pipeline component with various parameters, including the model path, compute clusters for different stages, dataset splits for training and testing, the number of GPUs to use for fine-tuning, and other fine-tuning parameters.

1. It maps the output of the fine-tuning job to the output of the pipeline job. This is done so that the fine-tuned model can be easily registered, which is required to deploy the model to an online or batch endpoint.

1. It creates an instance of the pipeline by calling the `create_pipeline` function.

1. It sets the `force_rerun` setting of the pipeline to `True`, meaning that cached results from previous jobs will not be used.

1. It sets the `continue_on_step_failure` setting of the pipeline to `False`, which ensures the pipeline halts if any step fails.  
4. In summary, this script sets up a machine learning pipeline for a chat completion task using the Azure Machine Learning SDK.  
```python
    # Import necessary modules from the Azure AI ML SDK
    from azure.ai.ml.dsl import pipeline
    from azure.ai.ml import Input
    
    # Fetch the pipeline component named "chat_completion_pipeline" from the registry
    pipeline_component_func = registry_ml_client.components.get(
        name="chat_completion_pipeline", label="latest"
    )
    
    # Define the pipeline job using the @pipeline decorator and the function create_pipeline
    # The name of the pipeline is set to pipeline_display_name
    @pipeline(name=pipeline_display_name)
    def create_pipeline():
        # Initialize the fetched pipeline component with various parameters
        # These include the model path, compute clusters for different stages, dataset splits for training and testing, the number of GPUs to use for fine-tuning, and other fine-tuning parameters
        chat_completion_pipeline = pipeline_component_func(
            mlflow_model_path=foundation_model.id,
            compute_model_import=compute_cluster,
            compute_preprocess=compute_cluster,
            compute_finetune=compute_cluster,
            compute_model_evaluation=compute_cluster,
            # Map the dataset splits to parameters
            train_file_path=Input(
                type="uri_file", path="./ultrachat_200k_dataset/train_sft.jsonl"
            ),
            test_file_path=Input(
                type="uri_file", path="./ultrachat_200k_dataset/test_sft.jsonl"
            ),
            # Training settings
            number_of_gpu_to_use_finetuning=gpus_per_node,  # Set to the number of GPUs available in the compute
            **finetune_parameters
        )
        return {
            # Map the output of the fine tuning job to the output of pipeline job
            # This is done so that we can easily register the fine tuned model
            # Registering the model is required to deploy the model to an online or batch endpoint
            "trained_model": chat_completion_pipeline.outputs.mlflow_model_folder
        }
    
    # Create an instance of the pipeline by calling the create_pipeline function
    pipeline_object = create_pipeline()
    
    # Don't use cached results from previous jobs
    pipeline_object.settings.force_rerun = True
    
    # Set continue on step failure to False
    # This means that the pipeline will stop if any step fails
    pipeline_object.settings.continue_on_step_failure = False
    ```  

### Submit the Job
1. This Python script submits a machine learning pipeline job to an Azure Machine Learning workspace and waits for the job to finish. Here's how it works:  
   - It uses the `create_or_update` method of the `jobs` object in `workspace_ml_client` to submit the pipeline job. The pipeline to execute is specified by `pipeline_object`, and the experiment name is defined by `experiment_name`.  
   - It uses the `stream` method of the `jobs` object in `workspace_ml_client` to wait for the pipeline job to complete, referring to the job's `name` attribute.  
   - In summary, this script submits a machine learning pipeline job to Azure Machine Learning and waits for its completion.  
```python
    # Submit the pipeline job to the Azure Machine Learning workspace
    # The pipeline to be run is specified by pipeline_object
    # The experiment under which the job is run is specified by experiment_name
    pipeline_job = workspace_ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
        pipeline_object, experiment_name=experiment_name
    )
    
    # Wait for the pipeline job to complete
    # The job to wait for is specified by the name attribute of the pipeline_job object
    workspace_ml_client.jobs.stream(pipeline_job.name)
    ```  

## 6. Register the Fine-Tuned Model with the Workspace
We will register the model output from the fine-tuning job. This will establish lineage between the fine-tuned model and the fine-tuning job, which in turn tracks lineage to the foundation model, data, and training code.  

### Registering the ML Model
1. This Python script registers a machine learning model trained in an Azure Machine Learning pipeline. Here's what it does:  
   - It imports the necessary modules from the Azure AI ML SDK.  
   - It checks if the `trained_model` output is available from the pipeline job by accessing the `outputs` attribute of the job retrieved through the `get` method of the `jobs` object in `workspace_ml_client`.  
   - It constructs a path to the trained model by formatting a string with the pipeline job name and the output name ("trained_model").  
   - It names the fine-tuned model by appending "-ultrachat-200k" to the original model name, replacing slashes with hyphens.  
   - It prepares the model for registration by creating a `Model` object with parameters such as the model path, type (MLflow model), name, version, and description.  
   - It registers the model using the `create_or_update` method of the `models` object in `workspace_ml_client`.  
   - It prints the registered model.  
   - In summary, this script registers a machine learning model trained in an Azure Machine Learning pipeline.  
```python
    # Import necessary modules from the Azure AI ML SDK
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import Model
    from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes
    
    # Check if the `trained_model` output is available from the pipeline job
    print("pipeline job outputs: ", workspace_ml_client.jobs.get(pipeline_job.name).outputs)
    
    # Construct a path to the trained model by formatting a string with the name of the pipeline job and the name of the output ("trained_model")
    model_path_from_job = "azureml://jobs/{0}/outputs/{1}".format(
        pipeline_job.name, "trained_model"
    )
    
    # Define a name for the fine-tuned model by appending "-ultrachat-200k" to the original model name and replacing any slashes with hyphens
    finetuned_model_name = model_name + "-ultrachat-200k"
    finetuned_model_name = finetuned_model_name.replace("/", "-")
    
    print("path to register model: ", model_path_from_job)
    
    # Prepare to register the model by creating a Model object with various parameters
    # These include the path to the model, the type of the model (MLflow model), the name and version of the model, and a description of the model
    prepare_to_register_model = Model(
        path=model_path_from_job,
        type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL,
        name=finetuned_model_name,
        version=timestamp,  # Use timestamp as version to avoid version conflict
        description=model_name + " fine tuned model for ultrachat 200k chat-completion",
    )
    
    print("prepare to register model: \n", prepare_to_register_model)
    
    # Register the model by calling the create_or_update method of the models object in the workspace_ml_client with the Model object as the argument
    registered_model = workspace_ml_client.models.create_or_update(
        prepare_to_register_model
    )
    
    # Print the registered model
    print("registered model: \n", registered_model)
    ```  

## 7. Deploy the Fine-Tuned Model to an Online Endpoint
Online endpoints provide a durable REST API that can be used to integrate the model with applications.  

### Manage Endpoint
1. This Python script creates a managed online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning for a registered model. Here's how it works:  
   - It imports the necessary modules from the Azure AI ML SDK.  
   - It generates a unique name for the online endpoint by appending a timestamp to "ultrachat-completion-".  
   - It prepares to create the online endpoint by initializing a `ManagedOnlineEndpoint` object with parameters like endpoint name, description, and authentication mode ("key").  
   - It creates the online endpoint using the `begin_create_or_update` method of `workspace_ml_client` and waits for the operation to complete with the `wait` method.  
   - In summary, this script creates a managed online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning for a registered model.  
```python
    # Import necessary modules from the Azure AI ML SDK
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import (
        ManagedOnlineEndpoint,
        ManagedOnlineDeployment,
        ProbeSettings,
        OnlineRequestSettings,
    )
    
    # Define a unique name for the online endpoint by appending a timestamp to the string "ultrachat-completion-"
    online_endpoint_name = "ultrachat-completion-" + timestamp
    
    # Prepare to create the online endpoint by creating a ManagedOnlineEndpoint object with various parameters
    # These include the name of the endpoint, a description of the endpoint, and the authentication mode ("key")
    endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
        name=online_endpoint_name,
        description="Online endpoint for "
        + registered_model.name
        + ", fine tuned model for ultrachat-200k-chat-completion",
        auth_mode="key",
    )
    
    # Create the online endpoint by calling the begin_create_or_update method of the workspace_ml_client with the ManagedOnlineEndpoint object as the argument
    # Then wait for the creation operation to complete by calling the wait method
    workspace_ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).wait()
    ```  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can find the list of supported SKUs for deployment here - [Managed online endpoints SKU list](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list)  

### Deploying ML Model
1. This Python script deploys a registered machine learning model to a managed online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning. Here's how it works:  
   - It imports the `ast` module to process Python abstract syntax trees.  
   - It sets the deployment instance type to "Standard_NC6s_v3".  
   - It checks if the `inference_compute_allow_list` tag exists in the foundation model. If it does, it converts the tag value to a Python list and assigns it to `inference_computes_allow_list`. Otherwise, it sets `inference_computes_allow_list` to `None`.  
   - It verifies if the specified instance type is in the allow list. If not, it prompts the user to select an instance type from the allow list.  
   - It prepares the deployment by creating a `ManagedOnlineDeployment` object with parameters like deployment name, endpoint name, model ID, instance type and count, liveness probe settings, and request settings.  
   - It creates the deployment using the `begin_create_or_update` method of `workspace_ml_client` and waits for completion with the `wait` method.  
   - It sets the endpoint traffic to route 100% to the "demo" deployment.  
   - It updates the endpoint using the `begin_create_or_update` method of `workspace_ml_client` and waits for completion with the `result` method.  
   - In summary, this script deploys a registered machine learning model to a managed online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning.  
```python
    # Import the ast module, which provides functions to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar
    import ast
    
    # Set the instance type for the deployment
    instance_type = "Standard_NC6s_v3"
    
    # Check if the `inference_compute_allow_list` tag is present in the foundation model
    if "inference_compute_allow_list" in foundation_model.tags:
        # If it is, convert the tag value from a string to a Python list and assign it to `inference_computes_allow_list`
        inference_computes_allow_list = ast.literal_eval(
            foundation_model.tags["inference_compute_allow_list"]
        )
        print(f"Please create a compute from the above list - {computes_allow_list}")
    else:
        # If it's not, set `inference_computes_allow_list` to `None`
        inference_computes_allow_list = None
        print("`inference_compute_allow_list` is not part of model tags")
    
    # Check if the specified instance type is in the allow list
    if (
        inference_computes_allow_list is not None
        and instance_type not in inference_computes_allow_list
    ):
        print(
            f"`instance_type` is not in the allow listed compute. Please select a value from {inference_computes_allow_list}"
        )
    
    # Prepare to create the deployment by creating a `ManagedOnlineDeployment` object with various parameters
    demo_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
        name="demo",
        endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
        model=registered_model.id,
        instance_type=instance_type,
        instance_count=1,
        liveness_probe=ProbeSettings(initial_delay=600),
        request_settings=OnlineRequestSettings(request_timeout_ms=90000),
    )
    
    # Create the deployment by calling the `begin_create_or_update` method of the `workspace_ml_client` with the `ManagedOnlineDeployment` object as the argument
    # Then wait for the creation operation to complete by calling the `wait` method
    workspace_ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(demo_deployment).wait()
    
    # Set the traffic of the endpoint to direct 100% of the traffic to the "demo" deployment
    endpoint.traffic = {"demo": 100}
    
    # Update the endpoint by calling the `begin_create_or_update` method of the `workspace_ml_client` with the `endpoint` object as the argument
    # Then wait for the update operation to complete by calling the `result` method
    workspace_ml_client.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```  

## 8. Test the Endpoint with Sample Data
We will fetch sample data from the test dataset, submit it to the online endpoint for inference, and display the scored labels alongside the ground truth labels.  

### Reading the Results
1. This Python script reads a JSON Lines file into a pandas DataFrame, selects a random sample, and resets the index. Here's what it does:  
   - It reads `./ultrachat_200k_dataset/test_gen.jsonl` into a pandas DataFrame. The `read_json` function is used with `lines=True` because the file is in JSON Lines format.  
   - It selects a random sample of 1 row using the `sample` function with `n=1`.  
   - It resets the DataFrame index using `reset_index` with `drop=True`.  
   - It displays the first 2 rows using the `head` function with the argument `2`. Since the DataFrame only has one row after sampling, only that row is displayed.  
   - In summary, this script reads a JSON Lines file into a pandas DataFrame, selects one random row, resets the index, and displays it.  
```python
    # Import pandas library
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Read the JSON Lines file './ultrachat_200k_dataset/test_gen.jsonl' into a pandas DataFrame
    # The 'lines=True' argument indicates that the file is in JSON Lines format, where each line is a separate JSON object
    test_df = pd.read_json("./ultrachat_200k_dataset/test_gen.jsonl", lines=True)
    
    # Take a random sample of 1 row from the DataFrame
    # The 'n=1' argument specifies the number of random rows to select
    test_df = test_df.sample(n=1)
    
    # Reset the index of the DataFrame
    # The 'drop=True' argument indicates that the original index should be dropped and replaced with a new index of default integer values
    # The 'inplace=True' argument indicates that the DataFrame should be modified in place (without creating a new object)
    test_df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
    
    # Display the first 2 rows of the DataFrame
    # However, since the DataFrame only contains one row after the sampling, this will only display that one row
    test_df.head(2)
    ```  

### Create JSON Object
1. This Python script creates a JSON object with specific parameters and saves it to a file. Here's what it does:  
   - It imports the `json` module to handle JSON data.  
   - It creates a dictionary `parameters` with keys "temperature", "top_p", "do_sample", and "max_new_tokens" and assigns values of 0.6, 0.9, `True`, and 200, respectively.  
   - It creates another dictionary `test_json` with keys "input_data" and "params". "input_data" contains another dictionary with keys "input_string" (a list with the first message from `test_df`) and "parameters" (the `parameters` dictionary). "params" is an empty dictionary.  
   - It opens a file named `sample_score.json`.  
```python
    # Import the json module, which provides functions to work with JSON data
    import json
    
    # Create a dictionary `parameters` with keys and values that represent parameters for a machine learning model
    # The keys are "temperature", "top_p", "do_sample", and "max_new_tokens", and their corresponding values are 0.6, 0.9, True, and 200 respectively
    parameters = {
        "temperature": 0.6,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "do_sample": True,
        "max_new_tokens": 200,
    }
    
    # Create another dictionary `test_json` with two keys: "input_data" and "params"
    # The value of "input_data" is another dictionary with keys "input_string" and "parameters"
    # The value of "input_string" is a list containing the first message from the `test_df` DataFrame
    # The value of "parameters" is the `parameters` dictionary created earlier
    # The value of "params" is an empty dictionary
    test_json = {
        "input_data": {
            "input_string": [test_df["messages"][0]],
            "parameters": parameters,
        },
        "params": {},
    }
    
    # Open a file named `sample_score.json` in the `./ultrachat_200k_dataset` directory in write mode
    with open("./ultrachat_200k_dataset/sample_score.json", "w") as f:
        # Write the `test_json` dictionary to the file in JSON format using the `json.dump` function
        json.dump(test_json, f)
    ```  

### Invoking Endpoint
1. This Python script invokes an online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning to score a JSON file. Here's what it does:  
   - It uses the `invoke` method of the `online_endpoints` property of the `workspace_ml_client` object to send a request to an online endpoint.  
   - It specifies the endpoint and deployment names with `endpoint_name` and `deployment_name` arguments, where the endpoint name is stored in `online_endpoint_name` and the deployment name is "demo".  
   - It provides the path to the JSON file (`./ultrachat_200k_dataset/sample_score.json`) with the `request_file` argument.  
   - It stores the endpoint response in the `response` variable.  
   - It prints the raw response.  
   - In summary, this script invokes an online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning to score a JSON file and prints the response.  
```python
    # Invoke the online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning to score the `sample_score.json` file
    # The `invoke` method of the `online_endpoints` property of the `workspace_ml_client` object is used to send a request to an online endpoint and get a response
    # The `endpoint_name` argument specifies the name of the endpoint, which is stored in the `online_endpoint_name` variable
    # The `deployment_name` argument specifies the name of the deployment, which is "demo"
    # The `request_file` argument specifies the path to the JSON file to be scored, which is `./ultrachat_200k_dataset/sample_score.json`
    response = workspace_ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
        endpoint_name=online_endpoint_name,
        deployment_name="demo",
        request_file="./ultrachat_200k_dataset/sample_score.json",
    )
    
    # Print the raw response from the endpoint
    print("raw response: \n", response, "\n")
    ```  

## 9. Delete the Online Endpoint
1. Remember to delete the online endpoint to avoid incurring costs for the compute resources used by the endpoint. This Python code deletes an online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning. Here's what it does:  
   - It calls the `begin_delete` method of the `online_endpoints` property of `workspace_ml_client` to start deleting the endpoint.  
   - It specifies the endpoint name with the `name` argument, stored in the `online_endpoint_name` variable.  
   - It uses the `wait` method to block further execution until the deletion is complete.  
   - In summary, this code deletes an online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning and waits for the process to finish.  
```python
    # Delete the online endpoint in Azure Machine Learning
    # The `begin_delete` method of the `online_endpoints` property of the `workspace_ml_client` object is used to start the deletion of an online endpoint
    # The `name` argument specifies the name of the endpoint to be deleted, which is stored in the `online_endpoint_name` variable
    # The `wait` method is called to wait for the deletion operation to complete. This is a blocking operation, meaning that it will prevent the script from continuing until the deletion is finished
