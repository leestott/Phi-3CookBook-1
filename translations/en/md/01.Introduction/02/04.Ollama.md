## Phi Family in Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) makes it easier for more people to deploy open-source LLM or SLM directly through simple scripts. It can also create APIs to support local Copilot application scenarios.

## **1. Installation**

Ollama is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download Ollama using this link: ([https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)). Once installed, you can use the Ollama script to call Phi-3 directly from the terminal. You can view all the [available libraries in Ollama](https://ollama.com/library). If you open this repository in a Codespace, Ollama will already be installed.

```bash

ollama run phi4

```

> [!NOTE]
> The model will be downloaded the first time you run it. Alternatively, you can specify the downloaded Phi-4 model directly. In this example, we use WSL to run the command. After the model is downloaded successfully, you can interact directly in the terminal.

## **2. Call the Phi-4 API from Ollama**

To call the Phi-4 API generated by Ollama, use the following command in the terminal to start the Ollama server.

```bash

ollama serve

```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using macOS or Linux, you might encounter the following error: **"Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:11434: bind: address already in use."** This typically means the server is already running. You can either ignore the error or stop and restart Ollama:

**macOS**

```bash

brew services restart ollama

```

**Linux**

```bash

sudo systemctl stop ollama

```

Ollama provides two APIs: generate and chat. Depending on your needs, you can call the model API provided by Ollama by sending requests to the local service running on port 11434.

**Chat**

```bash

curl http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat -d '{
  "model": "phi3",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Your are a python developer."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Help me generate a bubble algorithm"
    }
  ],
  "stream": false
  
}'

This is the result in Postman

## Additional Resources

Check the list of available models in Ollama in [their library](https://ollama.com/library).

Pull your model from the Ollama server using this command

```bash
ollama pull phi4
```

Run the model using this command

```bash
ollama run phi4
```

## Calling Ollama from Python

You can use `requests` or `urllib3` to make requests to the local server endpoints used above. However, a popular way to use Ollama in Python is via the [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) SDK, since Ollama provides OpenAI-compatible server endpoints as well.

Here is an example for phi3-mini:

```python
import openai

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",
    api_key="nokeyneeded",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="phi4",
    temperature=0.7,
    n=1,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about a hungry cat"},
    ],
)

print("Response:")
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Calling Ollama from JavaScript 

```javascript
// Example of Summarizing a file with Phi-4
script({
    model: "ollama:phi4",
    title: "Summarize with Phi-4",
    system: ["system"],
})

// Example of summarize
const file = def("FILE", env.files)
$`Summarize ${file} in a single paragraph.`
```

## Calling Ollama from C#

Create a new C# Console application and add the following NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.SemanticKernel --version 1.34.0
```

Then replace this code in the `Program.cs` file

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel.ChatCompletion;

// add chat completion service using the local ollama server endpoint
#pragma warning disable SKEXP0001, SKEXP0003, SKEXP0010, SKEXP0011, SKEXP0050, SKEXP0052
builder.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(
    modelId: "phi4",
    endpoint: new Uri("http://localhost:11434/"),
    apiKey: "non required");

// invoke a simple prompt to the chat service
string prompt = "Write a joke about kittens";
var response = await kernel.InvokePromptAsync(prompt);
Console.WriteLine(response.GetValue<string>());
```

Run the app with the command:

```bash
dotnet run
