# **Quantizing Phi-3.5 using Apple MLX Framework**

MLX is a machine learning framework optimized for Apple silicon, developed by Appleâ€™s machine learning research team.

Designed by and for machine learning researchers, MLX aims to be both user-friendly and highly efficient for training and deploying models. The frameworkâ€™s design is intentionally straightforward, making it easy for researchers to extend and enhance MLX to quickly experiment with new ideas.

LLMs can be accelerated on Apple Silicon devices using MLX, enabling convenient local execution of models.

The Apple MLX Framework now supports quantization conversion for Phi-3.5-Instruct (**Apple MLX Framework support**), Phi-3.5-Vision (**MLX-VLM Framework support**), and Phi-3.5-MoE (**Apple MLX Framework support**). Letâ€™s explore how to use it:

### **Phi-3.5-Instruct**

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct -q

```

### **Phi-3.5-Vision**

```bash

python -m mlxv_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-vision-instruct -q

```

### **Phi-3.5-MoE**

```bash

python -m mlx_lm.convert --hf-path microsoft/Phi-3.5-MoE-instruct  -q

```
